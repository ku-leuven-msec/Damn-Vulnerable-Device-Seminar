    <h2> About the Seminar</h2>
    <p>This hands-on session goes through the basics of pentesting via a concrete case study,
      namely a custom made IoT ecosystem consisting of an embedded device running on Linux
      that is communicating with an Android app. Both static and dynamic analysis tools as well
      as manual testing are applied to discover vulnerabilities in IoT ecosystems. Moreover, the
      tutorial provides pointers to prevent common vulnerabilities, and introduces a number of
      feasible tools to support the pentesting process. The core goal consists of giving a sneak peak
      into hacker/pentester tools and strategies, and convince the reader about the importance of
      embracing security when developing novel IoT ecosystems</p>
