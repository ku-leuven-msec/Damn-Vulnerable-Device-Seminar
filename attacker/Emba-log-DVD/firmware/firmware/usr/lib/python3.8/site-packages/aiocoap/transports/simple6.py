"""This module implements a MessageInterface for UDP based on the asyncio
DatagramProtocol.

This is a simple version that works only for clients (by creating a dedicated
unbound but connected socket for each communication partner) and probably not
with multicast (it is assumed to be unsafe for multicast), which can be
expected to work even on platforms where the :mod:`.udp6` module can not be
made to work (Android, OSX, Windows for missing ``recvmsg`` and socket options,
or any event loops that don't have an add_reader method).

Note that the name of the module is a misnomer (and the module is likely to be
renamed): Nothing in it is IPv6 specific; the socket is created using whichever
address family the OS chooses based on the given host name.

One small but noteworthy detail about this transport is that it does not
distinguish between IP literals and host names. As a result, requests and
responses from remotes will appear to arrive from a remote whose netloc is the
requested name, not an IP literal.

This transport is experimental, likely to change, and not fully tested yet
(because the test suite is not yet ready to matrix-test the same tests with
different transport implementations, and because it still fails in proxy
blockwise tests).

For one particular use case, this may be usable for servers in a sense: If (and
only if) all incoming requests are only ever sent from clients that were
previously addressed as servers by the running instance. (This is generally
undesirable as it greatly limits the usefulness of the server, but is used in
LwM2M setups). As such a setup makes demands on the peer that are not justified
by the CoAP specification (in particular, that it send requests from a
particular port), this should still only be used for cases where the udp6
transport is unavailable due to platform limitations.
